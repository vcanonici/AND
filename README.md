# AND — Information Hub (publish-ready)

This repository contains a segmented, publishable version of the "Initial Report" on accessibility and neurodivergence.

Contents
- `Initial Report.txt` — canonical source text.
- `content/` — segmented markdown files produced verbatim from the report, organized by topic.

How to publish
- Create a new GitHub repository and push this folder as-is. This repo is intentionally minimal — no local tooling is required for readers.

Notes
- Local tools and development artifacts (virtualenvs, scripts, backups) are intentionally excluded from the published tree and listed in `.gitignore`.
- If you want a GitHub Pages site, I can generate a `SUMMARY.md` and a small `mkdocs` configuration.

License
- This repository includes a `LICENSE` file at the root. Keep or replace it as appropriate for publication.

If you want me to make any of the following before publishing, tell me which:
- Commit the current changes and open a PR.
- Remove or permanently delete local tooling files (scripts, data artifacts).
- Generate a `SUMMARY.md` for GitHub Pages navigation.
- references/references.md — referências seletivas
